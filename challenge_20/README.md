# Challenge 20

In this case we need to install:

- gem install thread
- gem install async

Run the the next file to see the results:

- ruby challenge_20/challenge_20.rb

As result we get:

│10
│100
│800
│6000
│600
│600

where 10 is the result when we call the asyn_sum function with one second as sleep.
